This directory contains reference scripts. They are good examples of how to use `circusort`. To execute these examples you have to:

1. `cd` into this location
2. run the command: `$ python <script_name>.py`

Additionally, if you want to enable the remote feature of these scripts then:

1. uncomment the line `host = settings.host`
2. create an new file `settings.py` with the following content `host = '192.168.0.1'` or any other IP address.
